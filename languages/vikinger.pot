"The theme uses the BuddyPress xProfile groups and fields to allow site "
"members to enter information about themselves, like bio, personal, "
"interests, social links and account information.%sTo be able to show each "
"xProfile field group and its respective fields in different settings pages "
"and widgets in the members profiles, the theme has to query them by their "
"name.%sThis creates problems if users need to edit group or field names for "
"translations purposes, as the theme won't be able to find and display the "
"group or field information if the name is not the one it is expecting.To "
"solve this and allow users to translate them, we have included a new "
"customizer section with this update (\"Vikinger Settings\" -> \"xProfile "
"Groups / Fields\").%sTo understand how to edit the profile groups and fields "
"for translation purposes, we need to detail how the theme uses the group "
"names.%sxProfile group names consist of a prefix part (i.e. \"Profile\") "
"followed by an underscore (_) followed by the subgroup name (\"Bio\"): "
"\"Profile_Bio\".%sThe prefix part (in this example \"Profile\") is used to "
"identify on which settings page the group and all its fields will be "
"displayed in, to allow members to edit their information:"

"%sThe subgroup name part (in this example \"Bio\") is used to identify on "

"is displayed differently from the other fields (text only at the top of the "

"names from the backend \"Users\" -> \"Profile Fields\" page to translate "
"them and then enter that same name on the respective customizer \"Vikinger "
"Settings\" -> \"xProfile Groups / Fields\" option.%sThis allows the theme to "
"query the subgroup using the new name and display the information correctly "
"on each widget.%sAs we mentioned before, the \"Profile_Bio\" \"About\" field "
"is a special case and if changed, its new name has to be entered in the "
